## Introduction to the Repository
### Purpose of the Repository
To bring attention to the difference between the number of mental health providers availabe versus the rates of poor mental health days in different counties across the state of North Carolina. The NC Mental Health dataset provides data that can be useful in determining changes that can be made in the availiabilty of mental health providers in NC to better the overall mental health of the North Carolina population. 

### What the Repository/Dataset Provides
- Instructions for how to use Pandas in a Python notebook to compile a new dataset.
- Original .csv file for the dataset used to compile a data subset.
- The final .csv file for the compiled dataset.

### What this Repository Can be Used For
- To determine new ways to improve mental health aid across the state of North Carolina. 


## Getting Started 
### Locating Files 
The County Health .csv file is the only file that was used to compile the NC Mental Health subset. It can be found at the top of the repository. 
- Download the County Health .csv file and upload it into a program that runs Python. (Google Colabotory is what was used to create this subset, but any program that runs Python will work.)
- Make sure to import the Pandas package into your Python notebook. Further instructions for importing Pandas can be found in the Python notebook. (This notebook is linked at the top of the repository as well, labelled as "Documentation").
